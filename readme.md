# Magic Square Tic Tac Toe

This is a tic tac toe game using the Magic Square. Any combination of 3 numbers in a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally will equal 15. This project was done without class level objects as a challenge to myself.

Clone the code to your desktop and then, from your terminal run 
```ruby t3.rb```
